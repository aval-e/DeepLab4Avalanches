More documentation is provided in the form of docstrings throughout the code.

### Structure

* **datasets**: code for reading satellite images and ground truth labels in the form of pytorch datasets
* **evaluation**: various scripts for running quantitative and qualitative evaluation
* **experiments**: pytorch lightning module for running experiments in an easily configurable way
* **modeling**: model architecture and parts
* **trainer**: contains training scripts
* **utils**: various utilities for data manipulation, visualization, etc.

### Installation
Option 1:
1. Create virtual environment
2. Install gdal
3. Change to root directory
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `pip install -e .`

Option 2 (using anaconda):

1. Navigate to directory with environment.yml file and change the prefix path in the environment.yml file
2. Change the segm_models path in the requirements.txt file
3. run command `git submodule update --init --recursive` in root dir
4. `conda env create -f environment.yml` 
5. `conda activate eco`
6. `run pip install -e .` in the root dir and in the segm_models
 

### Training

Training can be run with  `bash run1yr.sh` or `bash run2yrs.sh` script. Training can be customised and hyperparameters set by passing the corresponding flags. All available options can be shown with:

`python trainer/train.py --help`

### Prediction

To automatically predict avalanches on new satellite images run `bash predict.sh` script. This creates a 1 band GeoTiff with probability values ranging from 0-1, where is certainly no avalanche, and 1 is certainly an avalanche. The predictions can be thresholded to get a binary map of predictions, with their certainty determined by the threshold.
Tile size and border size might have to be adapted to the desired resolution

The following flags need to be set:

* --image_dir: directory containing all satellite images
* --dem_path: path to the DEM if needed
* --region_file: a shapefile specifiying which region to predict over
* --output_path: the complete path and file name in which to store predictions. This will be a GeoTiff
* --checkpoint: the path to the desired .ckpt file
